<h2>Using CWR as a Multisite Business</h2>
<p>As a large multisite operator you face problems that many other businesses don't. Decentralised recruitment and on-boarding reduces visibility over existing processes for senior management, resulting in employees that may not be properly checked before being hired and rostered on.</p>

<p>Checkworkrights can be integrated through our API into existing HR management systems or used through our secure, customisable web application, assisting with work rights compliance during on-boarding and for the duration of a visa-holders employment. This can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial checks run based on existing data set</li>
<li>Resolving issues with existing data set</li>
<li>Review of existing systems and processes</li>
<li>Key stakeholders trained on the use and deployment of the Checkworkrights platform</li>
<li>Deployment of Checkworkrights scanning tool to site managers in the field</li>
</ul>
